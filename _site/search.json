I’m an Environmental Scientist and R developer, currently on a little break from data science and software development!\nI have previously worked as an Environmental Data Scientist and as a Spatial Data Analyst at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, where I developed tools and processes for the automated processing and quality assurance of air quality and climate change datasets, as well as developed interactive dissemination tools and reports for customers and stakeholders. I have also worked as a Data Intelligence Officer at the Suffolk County Council, where I maintained the SCC Planning organisation on Github.\nI have a BSc in Ecological & Environmental Sciences from the University of Edinburgh. I wrote my dissertation on vegetation change impact on arctic land-atmosphere interactions and snowmelt in the Arctic, and coded with a mix of Python and R. I was awarded the J.A. More Memorial Prize for best dissertation on a plant or crop topic."
